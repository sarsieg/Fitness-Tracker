## Challenge
For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the Develop folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
* The user should be able to:
1. Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
2. Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
3. View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
